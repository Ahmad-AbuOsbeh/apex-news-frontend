Data Flow:
First the user will encounter the home page which shows a preview of some of the latest news categorized into some various categories. Then they can navigate to other pages like the search by date or by location. After that the user will be given the option to log in to be able to submit a review or select favorite news categories to be always shown in the 'My News' page.
Non-functional requirements might be the APIs that will be providing the data and maybe bootstrap which will have the biggest influence on the web app's styling and structure.
